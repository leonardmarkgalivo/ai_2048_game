# Import necessary functions from game_functions
# Set constants for move parameters (e.g., number of searches, length)

# Define function to get search parameters based on move count

# Define function to simulate AI's best move:
#   - Loop over all 4 directions
#   - Simulate each move
#   - Add new tile if move was successful
#   - Run many simulated random moves to evaluate future score
#   - Store the average score for each direction
#   - Return the board state with the best move applied

# Define function to simulate a full game using AI:
#   - Loop until no moves are valid or 2048 is reached
#   - At each turn, calculate best move using AI
#   - Add tile and continue
#   - Print board and move count each turn
#   - Return max score reached

# Optional: define plotting function to show AI performance over many runs.
