# Import numpy for array and matrix operations
# Define constants for board size and tile values

# Define function to initialize game with two '2' tiles

# Define helper function to push non-zero tiles to the right

# Define helper function to merge tiles (same value, right to left)
#   - Return score gained and if anything merged

# Define move functions: move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down
#   - Rotate board as needed
#   - Push, merge, push again
#   - Rotate back
#   - Return new board, move_made, and score

# Define fixed move logic (prioritize left/up/down/right)

# Define random move logic:
#   - Randomly shuffle directions
#   - Try moves until a valid one is found

# Define function to add a new tile in empty cell (random 2 or 4)

# Define function to check if 2048 is reached
